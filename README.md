A proof of concept for an online management system for special permission numbers


Wrote this small flask app with adam rubenstien at a hackathon to learn about flask and webdev in general. Turned out really nice. Feel free to take it if you want an example flask app.


The views.py app needs to be given credentials for a sendgrid account. Just throw those in there before you try to run it. 
Then cd into the directory and type python views.py 
it will execute and run on localhost.
